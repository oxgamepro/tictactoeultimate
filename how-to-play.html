    <h2>1. Human vs AI</h2>
    <p>
      In this mode, you will play against the computer. You can select the difficulty level using emoji icons displayed on the screen:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>ðŸ˜Š Easy:</strong> AI makes random or weak moves, suitable for beginners.</li>
      <li><strong>ðŸ˜Ž Hard:</strong> AI uses blocking and predictive logic to challenge you.</li>
      <li><strong>ðŸ¤– God Mode:</strong> AI performs advanced strategies and may activate <strong>Ultimate Mode</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Click on any cell in the board to place your move. The AI will respond instantly based on the difficulty level selected. Emoji will change based on your selected difficulty, making it easy to understand the current mode.

    <h2>2. Human vs Human</h2>
    <p>
      This is a two-player offline mode where two players can play on the same device. No internet or AI is involved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Players take turns, and the app automatically switches between Player 1 and Player 2. It is great for playing with friends, siblings, or family members together.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Online Play</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Coming Soon!</strong> This mode will allow you to play live with other players online using an internet connection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each player will have a unique player ID. Youâ€™ll be able to invite friends, create game rooms, and challenge random players globally. Leaderboards and ranks will also be available for competitive players.

    <h2>4. Board Size Selection</h2>
    <p>
      Before starting the game, you can select your preferred board size â€“ 3x3 (classic), 5x5 (strategic), or 7x7 (ultimate challenge). Each board offers a different level of difficulty and game time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The game will adjust the winning rules accordingly. For example, in 5x5 you may need to place 4 symbols in a row to win, while 7x7 could require 5 in a row.

      When you click on a playerâ€™s name, a detailed view will appear showing their total wins, board preferences, favorite mode (easy/hard/god), and most recent performance.
