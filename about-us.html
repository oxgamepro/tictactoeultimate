    <h1>About the Game</h1>
    <p>
      Welcome to <strong>Tic Tac Toe Universe</strong> – a dynamic and exciting version of the classic Tic Tac Toe game, created with love, logic, and curiosity. I'm <strong>Ankit Thakur</strong>, a passionate developer who turned a simple idea into an evolving game project. What started as a small experiment quickly became a full-fledged creation that brings joy, competition, and challenge to players of all ages.
    </p>

    <p>
      I built this entire game using <strong>ChatGPT</strong> and the <strong>SPCK Editor</strong> app, directly on my mobile phone. I had no computer access during development, which made this journey more intense, but also very satisfying. Every line of code, feature, and design has been written, tested, and refined manually with care. This project represents not only technical learning but also creative growth and the hope of generating income through innovation.
    </p>

    <h2>Game Board Sizes & Rules</h2>
    <p>
      The game includes multiple board sizes to make gameplay more strategic and thrilling. Whether you are a beginner or a pro, there's a challenge waiting for you:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>3×3 Board:</strong> Win by getting 3 in a row. Perfect for quick matches.</li>
      <li><strong>5×5 Board:</strong> Get 4 in a row to win. More space means more planning!</li>
      <li><strong>7×7 Board:</strong> Win with 5 in a row. A true test of your logical thinking.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Game Modes</h2>
    <p>
      Tic Tac Toe Universe offers multiple ways to play:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Human vs AI:</strong> Challenge the smart AI system with 4 difficulty levels – Easy, Medium, Hard, and God Mode. Each level brings a new challenge.</li>
      <li><strong>Human vs Human:</strong> Play with friends on the same device. Great for offline fun!</li>
      <li><strong>Online Mode:</strong> If enabled, you can connect with players around the world and showcase your skills.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>God Level & Ultimate Mode</h2>
    <p>
      When you unlock the <strong>God Level</strong>, a special feature called <strong>Ultimate Mode</strong> becomes available. Here's how it works:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>3×3 Board:</strong> After every 7th move, the oldest move disappears, adding a twist to the game.</li>
      <li><strong>5×5 and 7×7 Boards:</strong> The disappearing logic adapts based on move count and player strategy, creating a more dynamic experience.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This mode keeps the game unpredictable and tests your ability to think ahead under pressure.
    </p>

    <h2>Leaderboard Feature</h2>
    <p>
      For those who manage to beat the AI in God Mode, your name will be featured in the <strong>God Mode Leaderboard</strong>. The more you win, the higher your rank climbs. This competitive feature adds long-term engagement and a reason to come back.
    </p>

    <h2>Why I Built This</h2>
    <p>
      I believe games should be fun, challenging, and something people can connect with. My goal with Tic Tac Toe Universe was not just to make another game, but to bring creativity, strategy, and accessibility together – even without powerful tools or big resources. Whether you’re playing to relax, compete, or just pass time, I hope this game gives you a reason to smile.
    </p>

    <p>
      This game will continue to evolve with time. I plan to add multiplayer matchmaking, animations, themes, and maybe even a story mode. Your feedback and support keep me going!
